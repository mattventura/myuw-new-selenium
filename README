Quick start:
Run server on localhost:8081
./main.py


By default, the test will use the expected data and cards to determine what users and dates to test automatically. There are some basic settings in main.py. 

Cards are defined in myuwCards.py. 
Expected data is defined in myuwExpected.py. 
Dates are defined in myuwDates.py. 
Everything else is supporting classes and functions. 

The tests have quick and dirty parallelization. On slower systems, this can cause the sqlite DB to lock up, so you'll want to either disable the parallelization or tone it down.
